# Purpose

Cleaning up data for gap analysis

# Data Import
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(data.table)
# Report from Web
data <- fread("Data/CAPR_Collections_Search_Results2019-06-03.csv",na.strings=c("",NULL,NA))

```

# Evaluate missingness of seed counts

```{r seed counts}
data[(`Seed Count`=='' | is.na(`Seed Count`) )& `Collection Type`=="Seed", .(Count=.N),by=c("Primary Seed Bank")]
```

*UCSC* - Seed counts are no where in the UCSC freezer storage records sent in 2018. I have had a hard time reaching them about this recently
*UCB* -
